# js.guide

Plan is to make comprehensive collection of javascript guides availble on internet.

If you have any better idea, feel free to share your idea by [creating new issue](https://github.com/js-guide/js.guide/issues/new).

As I am not actively working on this project, if any javascript focused community or open source projects feel they can do better with domain, I will be happy to help you. I can donate this domain.

You can always [create new issue](https://github.com/js-guide/js.guide/issues/new) or reach me at **_bWFkYW4ua2JoQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==_**  (base64).
